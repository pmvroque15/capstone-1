## Overview
**Gainful Ledger** is a Java CLI application that allows users to track deposits and payments, view a complete transaction history, and generate custom reports by date or vendor. The experience is enhanced with a fun gym-themed interface, featuring ASCII art menus and motivational messages.

## Biggest Challenge

One of the biggest challenges I faced was keeping the code condensed. My goal was to create reusable, simple methods and I'm proud to say I pulled it off! A great example of this is under the Custom Reports Menu: MTD, YTD, Previous Month, and Previous Year. Initially I had each report as its own separate method, but then I realized the logic behind each one was essentially the same, so I consolidated them all into one.  thought I could take advantage of date ranges, so I made good use of LocalDate and LocalTime to make that happen.

**The method call:**
```
displayTransactions(LocalDate start, LocalDate end, String type)
```

## Features
| **Adding Deposit And Payment Transactions** 	| Description prompts the user and collects all required transaction data via scanner inputs. Appends a new pipe-delimited transaction row to the file using  FileWriter and BufferedWriter without overwriting existing data. Filters the transaction type by taking in a transactionType String parameter to validate the entered amount. 	|

## Project Structure

Before jumping on my laptop and writing any code, I took some time to really understand the flow of the project. As a visual learner, it helps me to map everything out first — so I grabbed a piece of paper and sketched out some flowcharts the old fashioned way!

<img alt="IMG_3947.jpeg" src="utilities/IMG_3947.jpeg" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; width: 50%; transform: rotate(-90deg);"/>

P.S Not the best handwriting, but this is how it all started...

**The Project Tree**

Nothing too complicated here, just a clean setup to keep things organized.

### Running the App

1. Clone or download the project
2. Make sure `src/main/resources/transactions.csv` exists with a header row:
   ```
   date|time|description|vendor|amount
   ```
3. Compile and run `Main.java`:
   ```bash
   javac src/main/java/com/pluralsight/Main.java
   java com.pluralsight.Main
   ```
   Or run via your IDE (IntelliJ, Eclipse, etc.)

## How to use

### Main Menu
```
D  →  Add a Deposit
P  →  Make a Payment
L  →  Open the Ledger
X  →  Exit
```
### Ledger Menu
```
A  →  Display All Transactions (sorted newest first)
D  →  Display Deposits Only
P  →  Display Payments Only
R  →  Open Custom Reports
H  →  Go Back to Main Menu
```
### Custom Reports Menu
```
1  →  Month to Date
2  →  Previous Month
3  →  Year to Date
4  →  Previous Year
5  →  Search by Vendor
0  →  Go Back
```

When prompted, enter:

| Field       | Format         | Example              |
|-------------|----------------|----------------------|
| Date        | `MM/dd/yyyy`   | `04/29/2026`         |
| Time        | `HH:mm:ss`     | `14:35:00`           |
| Description | Free text      | `Monthly Membership` |
| Vendor      | Free text      | `Iron Planet Gym`    |
| Amount      | Decimal number | `59.99` or `-59.99`  |

**Deposits must be **positive**. Payments must be **negative**. The app will re-prompt if you enter the wrong sign.**

---
Transactions are stored in `transactions.csv` using pipe-delimited (`|`) values:

```
date|time|description|vendor|amount
04/29/2026|14:35:00|Monthly Membership|Iron Planet Gym|59.99
04/15/2026|09:10:00|Protein Supplements|GNC|−45.00
```

***The file is read on startup and appended to on every new transaction.***

## Error Handling

| Scenario                        | Response                                                    |
|---------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|
| File not found                  | `"File not found. It ghosted harder than your gym motivation."` |
| I/O error                       | `"I/O error. Something broke under pressure—too many reps."` |
| Wrong deposit amount (negative) | Re-prompts: `"Invalid input! Deposit must be positive."`   |
| Wrong payment amount (positive) | Re-prompts: `"Invalid input! Payments must be negative."`  |
| No matching transactions        | `"No transactions this month—your ledger is lighter than your warm-up set."` |
| Invalid menu input              | `"Wrong key! That rep doesn't count."`                     |
